# Deep-Learning-based-Image-Classification-CIFAR-10-
Developed a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implemented and compared Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images into 10 categories, achieving high accuracy through data normalization, model tuning, and evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras.
